Tesseroids and Fatiando

A bit of history about the projects but not specific use cases.

Talk about the current state of fatiando and Santiago's involvement.

Postdoct at University of Hawai'i working on the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT)

</div>

---

A bit about GMT and my involvement. Something about PyGMT and maybe that
picture of the steering council.

Our NSF grant and the next challenges facing GMT.

---

Something about the compgeolab. How we're building stuff on top of Fatiando.
What the research vision is the for the next couple of years.
Scaling up gravity and magnetic data processing using modern tools and a blend
of machine learning.

---

I've been immersed in scientific software for the last 12 years.

The importance of open-source software in science.

Everyone wants a piece of the Python cake.

Machine learning is open-source (scikit-learn, tensorflow, pytorch).

# Why quality is important

*Horror stories of public backlash*

---

Something about the spreadsheet bug.

A bit about the recent covid C code.

But also positive sides. Good software gets used. Used software generates
citations and collaborations.

Tesseroids usage for GOCE grids.

Building on top of previous work.
No hunting for bugs in already tested code.
Design for reuse.
Rapid prototyping for Moho inversion (idea to results in couple of days).
Even moderately documented generated use.

Our recent work on building scalable equivalent layers.
What do we need to make this work?
Based on Verde so talk a bit about it.
Software + ML + distributed.
Santi's work on block eql.
Work on cross-validation.
Next steps with Dask and Santi's work on iterative EQL.

What PIs, postdocs and students can do to make a difference.

Invest in software from the start.

Encourage training.

Value software work in evaluations.

Software Carpentry and the SSI.

Get involved in existing projects (learn by helping).
